I created this website in order to train my Django skills. In development I used of course Django, Python, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little bit of JavaScript and Ajax. For designing database I also used pgAdmin 4.

On this website you can create an account, login, ask and answer questions, edit them, mark questions as answered and answers as "valuable" (only in your own questions) and of course vote up and down on them.

Previously, this website was also available online, being hosted on Heroku.

Cheers!
